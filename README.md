Basket
======

The simplest way to save and share your favorite links.

Right now you stumble upon an article, video, list, or whatever it may be that you really like. How would you share this?
Facebook? Email? Twitter?

How would you save this link?
Bookmark? Evernote?

However you may share and save it will most likely get lost, and never found again.

Through a combination of collaborative folders, your facebook friend list, and a chrome extension, Basket will provide a one-stop shop for easily sharing and saving your favorite links.

Saving in Pocket + Sharing in Spotify = Basket
